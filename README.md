# Fantasy Football Regression Model - Using Team and Player Stats to Improve Fantasy Team Performance

## Introduction
In Fantasy Football, oftentimes, when deciding on whom to draft for a fantasy football team, users focus on their own team and player preference (i.e. their favorite teams and favorite players) and occasionally individual players past year’s performance. The problem here is that only the players past year’s performance is quantifiable, and emotional decisions like team and player preference do not have a quantifiable reasoning behind them, which can easily lead to poor overall fantasy team performance. In addition to this, users then miss out on otherwise extremely valuable insights, such as the past performance of the actual team that the individual players belong to (after all, football is a team sport), how various off-season trades and NFL draft picks will influence the performance of that team in the next year, and the expected difficulty of a teams schedule in the coming season (i.e. a receiver on a team that is playing a lot of other teams with a great passing defenses will have a more difficult time scoring fantasy points than a receiver on a team that is more often playing teams with poor passing defenses). This project addresses some of these issue by using both player and team stats and the upcoming season’s schedule to determine which teams are the best teams to draft players from.

### Data
In this project, I make use of the freely available NFL team, game, and player [datasets](https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data) from the [nflscrapR package](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) as well as professional football analyst proprietary data from [Pro Football Focus](https://www.profootballfocus.com/) to build my models.
