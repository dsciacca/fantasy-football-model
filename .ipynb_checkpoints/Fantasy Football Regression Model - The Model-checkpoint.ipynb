    "# Practicum I Project - Fantasy Football Multiple Regression Model - The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will finally get around to actually implementing the model itself. I plan to create multiple independent regression models and amalgamate them into a final projection score by team. Then, I will use those values as well as team schedules in order to determine which teams will have the easiest versus most difficult seasons. This way, I can select players from teams with easy seasons and avoid players on teams with difficult seasons, and having the whole season forecasted will allow me to know when to trade various players in order to reach the best outcomes. As usual, let's start by loading the necessary packages and reading in the data:"

    "Great. Now, as mentioned in my EDA notebook, I want focus on trying to maximize offsensive scoring in fantasy football, and I want to go about this by finding out which teams defenses are best at _preventing_ other teams from scoring offensive fantasy football points. For reference, [ESPN's Standard Scoring System](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/ffl/story?page=fflrulesstandardscoring) for offensive player is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Quarterbacks (QB), Running Backs (RB), Wide Receivers (WR), Tight Ends (TE)**  \n",
    "- 6 pts per rushing or receiving TD\n",
    "- 6 pts for player returning kick/punt for TD\n",
    "- 6 pts for player returning or recovering a fumble for TD\n",
    "- 4 pts per passing TD\n",
    "- 2 pts per rushing or receiving 2 pt conversion (note: teams do not receive points for yardage gained during the conversion)\n",
    "- 2 pts per passing 2 pt conversion\n",
    "- 1 pt per 10 yards rushing or receiving\n",
    "- 1 pt per 25 yards passing  \n",
    "*Bonus Points* (note: the player must score a touchdown to score the points)  \n",
    "- 2 pts per rushing or receiving TD of 40 yards or more\n",
    "- 2 pts per passing TD of 40 yards or more  \n",
    "*Penalty Points*    \n",
    "- -2 pts per intercepted pass\n",
    "- -2 pts per fumble lost  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, I want to find defensive teams that produce the most interceptions and lost fumbles while preventing TDs and yards. In this way, my independent variable at its core is Team while my dependent variables will be points, yards, TDs, interceptions, and fumbles lost (I will use primarily scaled values unless the column is binary since these columns didn't make sense to scale). Since my datasets are disparate and theres no good way to combine them column-wise, I will create a number of separate models and amalgamate values on a team basis at the end. At some point along the line, I will have to divide the datasets up by team for the ones that aren't already naturally segmented this way and then use the models to predict overall values on a team basis. Let's get started with the `pbp` dataset by first viewing it and determining exactly which dependent variables will be used from this dataset:"

I'm actually very interested in figuring out how I can use R code in these Jupyter notebooks, so I'm going to see if I can make this happen. From my research, I found that I can load an R kernel and perform my analyses in R, then I will write out the results of these analyses to a Python dataframe and wrap up/do visualizations using Python.

    "Awesome, now that all of the data is read into the R kernel, I can begin building my models. I will build my first model using the data from the `games` dataset. For this model, I will use `home_score_scaled` and `away_score_scaled` as my DVs and `home_team` and `away_team` as my predictor variables. Since the values of `home_score` and `away_score` use the same units, I don't really _need_ to use the scaled value; however, since I plan to amalgamate the coefficients of this model with the coefficients of models using variables that have different units, I will stick with the scaled values, otherwise I might introduce some bias into my overall predictions."

    "Awesome! Now I can use these values down the line for my amalgamation. There are some important things to note here, though. First off, `ARI`, or Arizona, is completely missing from this dataset (the teams themselves are sorted alphabetically, so this really should be the first in the above output). This is because the process of dummifying the variables takes one of the categories of the categorical variable and uses this as the base comparison, and in this case the category chosen happened to be `ARI`, or Arizona. I didn't lose this information, however, as this is where the `intercept` came from! So, I will eventually rename the intercept row to `ARI`. Something else to note is that there are two values for every other team: one for when the team is an away team, and the other for when the team is a home team. I will need to combine these values somehow down the line, and the way I plan to do this is by taking the average of each teams away value and home value. I'll take care of this later, though. \n",

    "For now, I want to continue on with creating other models. I will use this same pattern described above for each model in order to get the coefficients into Python dataframes. The next model I want to knock out is using the `pbp` dataset. From this dataset, I will use the columns relating to yards as my DV, so `yards_gained_scaled`, `air_yards_scaled`, and `yards_after_catch_scaled` as my DVs and then I will use `defteam` and `posteam` as my IVs as yards are related to who is in posession of the ball. Also, since being the `defteam` vs being the `posteam` is an important difference rather than the rather arbitrary difference of `home_team` vs `away_team`, I will do these in two separate models with a single IV in each:"

    "Continuing on with the `pbp` dataset, the next thing I want to do is predict `interceptions`, `fumbles` and `touchdowns` based on team. Since these columns are binary columns, I will need to use a logistic regression approach, and to do this I will use the `glm` function, or general linear model, in R, which will allow me to specify the family of the glm as `binomial` with a linking function of `logit` for logistic regression. As mentioned previously, I really only care about how good defensive teams are at _causing_ interceptions or fumbles and preventing touchdowns, so I will just use `defteam` as my IV. Additionally, I will create three models, one for each of my DVs. Let's start with interceptions:"

Something that would be interesting to do, but that I won't here because I simply do not have time, is to use these datasets to score teams on how well they do overall, in regards to passing, and in regards to rushing so that I could then score schedule difficulty in all three of these realms, helping me to know which teams to choose running backs from (teams with an easier running schedule) versus which to choose quarterbacks ane wide receivers from (teams with an easier passing schedule). This is something I'll implement sometime after this class when I have the time. \n",

    "For now, I will simply create my models based on overall player scores, predicted by teams, in order to determine which teams have higher caliber defenses, which should translate directly into how difficult a defensive team is to play against. Since I will only be using overall scores and not pass rush, run def, and coverage scores, and all of my positional groups datasets contain the overall score column, I am going to extract just the team and overall score column from each dataset and create a single dataset so that I can create one model instead of having one for each positional group. Something that I'm realizing might have a biasing effect on my model from these datasets is the fact that not all players really end up playing all that often (which is captured by the `TOTAL_SNAPS` column), and according to the correlations from the EDA dataset this directly links to having a lower overall score, which would likely have a negative impact on my model. To address this, I will drop rows from the positional groups datasets in which the `TOTAL_SNAPS` is less than the average number of `TOTAL_SNAPS` from that dataset before grabbing the `TEAM` and `OVERALL_scaled` columns from the dataset and appending it to my new dataset.

Not only that, but when I put these together like I'm about to, this will also significantly alter the dataset and how scaling should be done with it. Because of this, I need to capture the original `OVERALL` column from each dataset, and then after putting all of these together into a single, larger dataset I will need to redo the scaling.

This is somewhat surprising to me as I expected there to be more differences here, but perhaps this is due to the fact that this data comes from professional football analysts and thus the scores are somewhat subjective, which could account for some of the lack of variation.

    "Alright, now that everything is in place I need to start deciding what will go into my final team scores and what I'll leave out. As mentioned previously, I want to build a model based on defensive team strength, so what really matters in this context are models that were built using the defensive team as the basis, which doesn't apply to all of the models I built. Some of them were related to the possession team (`yards_by_posteam_model`) while others were based off of home and away team (`scores_by_team_model`) and neither of these tell me much about defensive team strength. Because of this, I won't use these models in my final amalgamation because they simply don't fit the context of the overall scores I'm trying to calculate. These could prove useful in the future if/when I decide to expand this model, but right now they don't fit into what I'm trying to do. On the other hand, I will include the following model coefficients in my final team scores as all of these are related to defensive team strength, either by using `defteam` as the predictor variable or by coming from defensive positional group stats, thus telling me about defensive team strength:\n",

    "- interceptions_model\n",
    "- fumbles_model\n",
    "- TDs_model\n",
    "- pos_groups_model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that all of this is sorted out, I want to get all of these coefficients into a single dataset for ease of use. To do this, I will use the Pandas `merge()` method to join my datasets using essentially an SQL inner join:"

    "Looking good! One issue I'm noticing, however, is that the columns in which logistic regression was used (`interceptions_coef`, `fumbles_coef`, and `TDs_coef`) all have a much larger values compared to the other columns, likely because of the difference in the way logistic regression is calculated versus standard linear regression. Because of this, I will scale these columns using the UDF from above in order to get all columns on a level playing field. Then, I can apply my own weighting so that each column is proportionate to the number of fantasy football points that they represent:"

    "Perfect! Now I was originally planning to weight yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and fumbles according to the amount of points they actually contribute to fantasy football scores; however, this introduces some issues because touchdowns are by far worth the most points (i.e. 6) while yards are worth relatively few when you boil it down to the yard (i.e. 0.1 points per rushing or receiving yard or 0.04 points per passing yard), yet yards are a much more common means of receiving fantasy points than touchdowns. I'm not exactly certain how to go about weighting these, and I am tempted to simply leave them unweighted, but another issue is that I have three columns that are related to yards but just one related to touchdowns, thus not weighting yards might bias the model toward teams that are good at stopping yardage. Of course, yards are a more frequent occurance than touchdowns, so honestly this is a good thing as [this CBS Boston article](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/09/19/nfl-scoring-touchdown-problem/) explains that there is an average of just under 2.5 touchdowns per team per game. For this reason, I won't weight the TDs column since TDs are worth a significant number of points but I also won't weight the yards columns as this will help to factor in the more likely contribution of yards to fantasy football points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I still have to consider what to do with interceptions and fumbles. These are worth negative points, so at the very least I will weight these columns by -1; however, these events, like touchdowns, don't happen terribly often. In fact, according to this [NFL by the Numbers](http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/64441086/nfl-statistical-analysis-average-nfl-game) article, they are essentially just as common as touchdowns, yet their worth -1/3 times the points compared to touchdowns. For this reason, I will weight the `interceptions_coef_scaled` and `fumbles_coef_scaled` columns by -0.34.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I must consider how to weigh the `overall_score_coef_scaled` column. Unfortunately, this column doesn't directly translate into points but rather is an indicator of the strength of a defensive team overall. Since this represents the overall strength of a defense, the higher the number the more difficult, at least theoretically, it would be to score fantasy points against that team, thus this column should be weighted by some negative number at the very least. Beyond knowing that I should weight this by a negative number, though, I really don't know how to quantify this overall defensive team strength in relation to ability to stop yards/touchdowns or cause fumbles/interceptions. For this reason, I will just weight this column by -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "I realize that it is certainly not ideal for me to come up with this weighting myself, but it's the best option I have right now and I will be sure to see how this season goes and take detailed notes throughout so that I can iterate back over my model to try to improve it next year. For now, let's take care of the weighting:"

With that I have my teams scored, and now I can use these values to create a strength of schedule dataset to determine which teams have more difficult schedules and which have easier so that I can then select players for my fantasy teams based off of the teams that have easier schedules! Let's take a look at how these teams stack against each other by sorting the values of the dataset. As noted above, a more negative score means a more difficult team to play against, so I will sort ascending to see which team as the most negative score, i.e. the best defense/hardest defense to score fantasy points against:"

    "Awesome! Now there's one more change I need to make before I can proceed: Notice that starting in week 4, some teams have their opponent listed as `BYE`. This indicates that this is a bye week for that team and they won't be playing that week. Every team has the same number of bye weeks throughout the season, so this won't cause any problems for me; however, I do need to artificially add `BYE` as a team to my `team_scores` dataset and assign it a score of 0 so that this won't through off my ability to obtain overall season scores for teams down the line by adding up scores accross rows. Let's take care of this now:"

    "Looks good! Now I'll create the heatmap using `seaborn`, but first I'll need to cast all of the values to numeric values as they are currently strings since my use of the `replace()` method from earlier only replaced single values at a rather than an entire column, so the numeric values I entered were implicitly cast to `object` type in order to match the rest of the column. In my heatmap, I will have red indicate a difficult game and blue indicate an easier game, with the colors in between representing the full spectrum there:"

From this alone it's hard to tell who has the easiest versus most difficult schedule, but I can tell from just a quick glance that there are some teams with almost no blue, or easy games, whatsoever (i.e. the LA Rams, Pitsburg, Miami, and Cleveland). In order to get an idea of the overall season difficulty by team, I want to add up the values for each team accross the rows in the schedule dataset. This will give me a good indication of what teams to pick players from in my fantast drafts as players on teams with a generally higher season score are more likely to score fantasy point and it will also tell me which teams to avoid drafting players from as teams with a generally lower season score will have more difficulty scoring fantasy points:"

    "Fascinating! It looks like my eyeballing was somewhat correct: according to the model, the Cleveland Browns are going to have the toughest go of it this year in terms of schedule difficulty, so I should make sure to avoid drafting players from the Browns in my fantasy drafts. On the other hand, the following are the top 5 teams in terms of ease of  schedule, thus I should prioritize drafting players from these teams: \n",
    "1. Chicago Bears\n",
    "2. Minnesota Vikings\n",
    "3. Tennessee Titans\n",
    "4. Carolina Panthers\n",
    "5. Indianapolis Colts\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of that I have all the information I was hoping to obtain. I have ample ideas for ways to improve my model going forward, such as by separating out running and passing defensive strength and producing a strength of schedule in those regards as well so that I know which teams to pick running backs from as well as wide receivers, and quarterbacks from, respectively. I'd also like to create models based on offensive productivity so that I can then use that in my decisions for which teams to draft from because as it stands, sure the Vikings are supposed to be second and the Titans third in my defensive strength of schedule model, but the difference between these teams is pretty minimal, and what if the Titans have a better overall offense? I'm currently missing out on insights like these, so I plan to make these kinds of improvements after this class as well as in future iterations through my model. "
